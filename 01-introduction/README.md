# Introduction

Today we're going to explore all the technologies available in browsers today that can be brought together to build **offline websites**.

## Me

- Core dev FT web app, Economist HTML5 app (both successful offline-first applications)
- Author of tutorial series: [How to make an offline HTML5 web app, FT style](http://labs.ft.com/2012/08/basic-offline-html5-web-app/)
- [Building A Simple Cross-Browser Offline To-Do List With IndexedDB And WebSQL on Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/09/02/building-simple-cross-browser-offline-todo-list-indexeddb-websql/)

## You

- How would you describe your JavaScript skills?
- What do you hope to gain from today?

## Course structure

The structure of this course will be very practical, focused on building prototypes, and will typically follow this pattern:

- Hack something together that works.
- Talk about why it works (explaining any browser APIs that we've used that may be unfamiliar).
- Discuss why it's inefficient or inelegant and then improve on it.
- There are exercises at the end of many sections if you finish the core material quickly.
