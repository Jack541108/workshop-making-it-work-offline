## What happens to Google Analytics data?

Basically, nothing.

- For each tracking event Google Analytics will try to send a tracking event to the server.
- As the device is offline that tracking event will fail.
- Google Analytics will not retry or store that data locally for retry later.
- **If you want to keep that data, you will have to implement the storing and resending of it yourself.**
