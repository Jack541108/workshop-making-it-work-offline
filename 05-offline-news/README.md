# Offline News Website

Weâ€™re going to make a simple offline-first to-do application with HTML5 technology. Here is what the app will do:

- store data offline and load without an Internet connection;
- automatically download the latest stories when there is a good connection
- run on the first- and second-most recent versions of all major desktop and mobile browsers.

## Why news?

Content-based websites (which includes websites other than news sites, such as Wikipedia, where the focus is on **reading** rather than **doing** make up a huge proportion of the world wide web)
but are a use case that stretches AppCache to its limits.

This makes building a simple offline news website a good example to explore AppCache and its replacement, Service Worker, in depth.  Also it will be possible to takes these tips and tricks and
apply them **immediately** to most websites.
